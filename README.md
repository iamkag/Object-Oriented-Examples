# Object-Oriented Programming Examples in Python

This repository provides a collection of Python examples that demonstrate fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It's designed to help learners understand and apply OOP principles through practical code snippets.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

* **`bank_account.ipynb`**: An interactive Jupyter Notebook that illustrates the creation and management of a `BankAccount` class, showcasing concepts like encapsulation, methods, and class instantiation.

* **`modular_arithmetic.ipynb`**: This notebook demonstrates how to implement modular arithmetic operations using classes, highlighting operator overloading and method definitions.

## üß† Concepts Covered

The examples in this repository cover key OOP concepts, including:

* **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes and creating object instances.

* **Encapsulation**: Restricting access to object data and methods.

* **Methods**: Implementing functions within classes to define object behaviors.

* **Operator Overloading**: Customizing the behavior of standard operators for user-defined classes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore the examples:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamkag/Object-Oriented-Examples.git
   cd Object-Oriented-Examples
   ```



2. **Open the notebooks**:

   Use Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to open and run the `.ipynb` files.
